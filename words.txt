With occasional brief interruptions, our journeys to the Planet,
astronomically known as Mars, but to its inhabitants as Ento, which
in the Ento language signifies chosen, or set apart, extended from
October 6, 1892, to September 16, 1894. During this period, through a
rather rare phase of mediumship, which we term semi-automatism, the
objective, or soul consciousness of our instrument was controlled
to write certain observations and experiences, but through various
unavoidable conditions, the record was somewhat imperfect, fragmentary
and altogether too voluminous for the purpose in view. Hence, when
after quite two years, during which she gradually recovered from the
devitalized condition, to which her devotion to a most worthy object
had reduced her, she expressed her readiness to permit herself to
pass under my control for the purpose of revising the manuscript, the
contents of which she was almost wholly ignorant, I found myself a
little dismayed over the magnitude of our mutual undertaking, which
I well knew would tax our endurance to the utmost, and certainly,
only patient, persistent endeavor on the part of our instrument, and
myself, has resulted in what, at the best, we all consider a not very
satisfactory rendition of experiences as unique as ever have occurred
to one yet embodied in physical form. So unique, indeed, that she
shrinks from the probable, nay, the certain unpleasant criticism which
the presentation of not new, but unrecognized facts, may elicit, and
it is only through the persistent entreaties of friends on both sides
of life that finally she has decided to offer for publication the
rather sketchy narrative of our journeys to Ento. Possessing neither
a natural, nor a cultivated ability, for a pictured presentation
of form, our spirit artist, Aaron Poole, has found it difficult to,
through her automatism, represent even some of the simpler examples
of the Flora of your neighboring Planet, but I may assure you that,
though from an artistic standpoint, they are somewhat crude, they
convey a fairly correct idea of the form and color, of the species
of plant life they represent. Also, I may state that our mission to
Ento was undertaken for a specific purpose, the record of its various
features being a secondary affair, but of sufficient importance to
induce us to undertake the task, which to all concerned, has been
purely a labor of love. Largely, it has been written for the purpose of
affording our Earthians information which only through the mediation
of discarnated spirits can be obtained. To scientific inquiry, in
whatsoever direction, there is a limit beyond which the physically
embodied man cannot penetrate, but to freed, most exalted spirits from
whom we receive instruction, the depths of unthinkably boundless space
are accessible. To spirits less exalted as we are, the planets of our
solar system afford free fields of observation, and in some far distant
time you and we, dear reader, through loving service for Humanity, may
find ourselves so purified, through earnest investigation and lofty
aspiration, so learned, so exalted, that together we may journey beyond
suns and worlds of which your photographers catch imprints, as faint
as smiles on the white faces of your dear dead. And may we hope that
in reading of our mission to Ento, you may find some expression of
thought, some lesson which may aid you in ascending the heights, ever
leading toward exalted states of being, thus nearer to a realizing
sense of the all pervading, infinite spirit of an infinite universe. We
pray that it may be so.
